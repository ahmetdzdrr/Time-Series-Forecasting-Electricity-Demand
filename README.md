## Introduction

The electricity demand project focuses on predicting energy consumption, utilizing a dataset covering the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The dataset encompasses hourly records and includes various environmental features alongside the electricity demand. The task involves forecasting the electricity demand for the initial three months of 2018.

The dataset consists of several columns providing diverse environmental factors:

- **datetime**: Time stamp for each hourly record.
- **precipitation**: Quantity of precipitation during the given hour.
- **temperature**: Hourly temperature measurement.
- **irradiance_surface**: Surface irradiance data.
- **irradiance_toa**: Irradiance data measured at the top of the atmosphere.
- **snowfall**: Amount of snowfall during the hour.
- **snow_mass**: Measurement of snow mass.
- **cloud_cover**: Percentage of cloud cover.
- **air_density**: Air density during the specific hour.
- **demand**: The electricity demand recorded for each hour.
- 
The objective of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to build models that can accurately forecast the electricity demand for the first quarter of 2018, based on historical patterns and the provided environmental data.

## What is Time-Series-Forecasting?

Time series forecasting is a statistical technique used to predict future data points based on previously observed values in a chronological sequence. It's specifically designed for data that is collected and indexed in time order, such as hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly intervals.

The primary goal of time series forecasting is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to make predictions about future values. This method accounts for the inherent sequential dependencies in the data, considering factors like seasonality, trends, cyclic patterns, and irregular fluctuations.

Various methods, including statistical models and machine learning algorithms, are employed in time series forecasting. These methods utilize historical data to develop models that capture the underlying structure of the time series. The models are then used to forecast future values, enabling businesses and analysts to make informed decisions, plan resources, and anticipate future trends based on past observations.

Overall, time series forecasting plays a vital role in numerous fields, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, inventory management, and many others, aiding in making accurate predictions and facilitating strategic decision-making processes.
